# HTML Assessments

This is a collection of HTML assessments that I completed for my class *TCSS460 - Client/server Programming for Internet Applications*.
The assessments are based on the material from this website: [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)
